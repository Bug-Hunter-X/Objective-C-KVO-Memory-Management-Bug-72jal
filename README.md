This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  The bug occurs when an observer is not properly removed before the observed object is deallocated, leading to potential crashes.  The solution shows the correct way to manage KVO observers to prevent this issue.  See `KVO_Bug.m` for the buggy code and `KVO_Bug_Solution.m` for the corrected version.
